Group theory: A group is a set X with an operation that is associative, has
  identity, has inverses
Cool number: G's powers generate all elements of the group is called a
  "Generator" of the group
Mod n prime p, the group has a phi of p, that group always has at least one
  Generator. Always one with primes
find generators for 31
